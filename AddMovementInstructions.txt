	  /*
      * At the moment, GameManager does not handle movement. For example, if a player types ‘n’, they are
	   * expected to move north into a new cell. This can only occur if the move is valid. If the move will place
	   * them outside the confines of the map, it should be disallowed. This can be described thusly:
	   * 
	   * Move:
	   * 	Input: 
	   * 			character direction is an element of {'n';'e';'s';'w'}
	   * 			integer playerX given by the player’s x coordinate.
	   *			integer playerY given by the player’s y coordinate.
	   * 	
	   *	Output:
	   *			INVALID MOVES - 
	   * 			String "Can’t go north!" if playerY ≤ 0 and direction = n
	   * 			String "Can’t go south!" if 5 ≤ playerY and direction = s
	   * 			String "Can’t go west!" if playerX ≤ 0 and direction = w
	   * 			String "Can’t go east!" if 5 ≤ playerX and direction = e
	   * 
	   * 			VALID MOVES - 
	   * 			integer playerY − = 1 if 0 < playerY ≤ 5 and direction = n
	   * 			integer playerY + = 1 if 0 ≤ playerY < 5 and direction = s
	   * 			integer playerX− = 1 if 0 < playerX ≤ 5 and direction = w
	   * 			integer playerX+ = 1 if 0 ≤ playerX < 5 and direction = e
	   *
	   * 			Update GameManager to support this functionality. Alternative, implement this functionality in its own
	   * 			class and call it from GameManager.
